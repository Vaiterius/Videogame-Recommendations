# Videogame-Recommendations
A project for COMP 541 that mines data from a gaming dataset to recommend videogames to players based on reviews and their preferences with content-based filtering and collaborative-based filtering using data mining techniques and algorithms

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/antonkozyriev/game-recommendations-on-steam).

The `games.csv`, `users.csv`, `recommendations.csv`, and `games_metadata.json` are not committed to this repository but
if you want to run the program, you can download them from the link and place them in the 'dataset/' folder. The dataset
should be updated monthly according to the page.
